                        Intuitively, the <b>rule of sum</b> states that the number of ways to do something plus the number of ways to do another thing is the total number of ways to do either. In mathematical terms:
                    </p>
                    <div class="math-definition">
                        The cardinality of the <a href="../set-operation#union">union</a> of finite sets \(A_1, ... A_n\), such that none of the sets share elements in common (they are pairwise disjoint) is the sum of their individual cardinalities:
                        $$|A_1 \cup ... \cup A_n| = |A_1| + ... + |A_n|$$
                    </div>
                    <div class="math-notice">
                        ⚠ In keeping with the whole "number of ways to do a thing" metaphor, imagine each set above as the set of all the different ways to do its associated "thing."
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        It should be clear that \(A_1 \cup ... \cup A_n\) is the set that contains all the elements of \(A_1, ... A_n\). Since these sets are pairwise disjoint, we don't need to worry about accidentally counting an element twice, so \(|A_1 \cup ... \cup A_n|\) is exactly equal to the sum of the number of elements in each set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an example, suppose that your choices for dessert tonight can be split up into two categories, being: pies \(\set{\text{pumpkin pie}, \text{cherry pie}, \text{shoo-fly pie}}\) and cakes \(\set{\text{chocolate cake}, \text{cheesecake}}\). Among these desserts, you can only choose \(1\). How many choices do you have? The rule of sum says you have exactly \(3 + 2 = 5\) choices of dessert. One such choice would be \(\text{cheesecake}\). Notice that you are not choosing one from each category, but instead one out of all the categories combined. This is what distinguishes when you want to use the rule of sum versus the <a href="../rule-of-product">rule of product</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that a case-insensitive password is defined as a string of \(10\) to \(12\) alphanumeric characters, meaning that there are \(26 + 10 = 36\) choices for each character by the rule of sum. How many unique passwords exist? Well, applying the rule of product tells us that the number of unique passwords of length \(10\) would be \(36^{10}\). With similar logic, we can find that there are \(36^{11}\) unique \(11\)-character passwords and \(36^{12}\) unique \(12\)-character passwords. Finally, by the rule of sum, there are \(36^{10} + 36^{11} + 36^{12}\) unique passwords to choose from. One such password would be \(\text{cheesecake}\). Haha, \(\text{cheesecake}\) worked for both examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's move onto an example with binary strings. How many binary strings of length \(4\) or \(5\) exist that start with a \(0\)? Well, if the first character must be restricted to \(0\), we have only \(1\) option for it, being \(0\). That means the rule of product would determine that there are \(1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\) binary strings of length \(4\) that start with \(0\), and  \(1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16\) binary strings of length \(5\) that start with \(0\). Since a binary string cannot have both length \(4\) and \(5\), the set of binary strings of length \(4\) that start with \(0\) is disjoint from the set of binary strings of length \(5\) that start with \(0\), allowing us to use the sum rule to find that there are \(8 + 16 = 24\) binary strings of length \(4\) or \(5\) that start with a \(0\).
                    </p>
                    <div class="math-notice">
                        ⚠ Observe that when one of the characters in a binary string of length \(n\) is restricted, there become \(2^{n-1}\) options for it, the same as the number of binary strings of length \(n-1\). It should make sense that restricting \(1\) character has the same effect as reducing the length by \(1\), because both cause you to lose exactly \(1\) choice of character.
