                        A <b>logical operation</b> transforms individual <a href="../proposition">propositions</a> into <a href="../compound-proposition">compound propositions</a>. Most logical operations are analogues to natural English expressions such as "not," "and," "or," and "if."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's the order in which logical operations should be evaluated:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Parentheses</li>
                        <li>Negation (\(\lnot\))</li>
                        <li>Conjunction (\(\land\))</li>
                        <li>Disjunction (\(\lor\))</li>
                        <li>Any other logical operation (Parentheses should indicate order)</li>

                    <p>
                        Logical operations can be unary or binary, meaning they operate on one or two propositions, respectively.

It is true only if both \(p\) and \(q\) are true, and false if \(p\) is false, \(q\) is false, or both \(p\) and \(q\) are false.

                    <p>In conversation, when we say "or," we sometimes mean that only one of two options is true. But in a disjunction, both options are allowed to be true. To get rid of this ambiguity, the exclusive disjunction was created. Its <a href="../compound-proposition#truth-table">truth table</a> resembles disjunction with just one notable exception.</p>

                        Exclusive disjunction is a binary logical operation that results in a compound proposition which is true if and only if the starting propositions have opposite truth values. The exclusive disjunction of propositions \(p\) and \(q\) is the proposition \(p \oplus q\) and is read "either \(p\) or \(q\)". It is true only if just \(p\) is true or just \(q\) is true, and false if both are true, or both are false.
