## About the project

Discretopia (https://discretopia.com) is an educational website that acts as a unified, organized, and friendly guide to the essential topics covered in a college-level discrete mathematics course.

With a highly-linked structure inspired by Wikipedia, related concepts are no more than a few clicks away. In addition to making it easier to review previously covered topics as needed, this level of interconnectedness also provides readers the opportunity to go down a discrete math rabbit hole and satisfy their curiosity.

## Key features

- Well-written, thoughtful entries on 80+ discrete math topics, including: logic, proofs, set theory, functions, algorithms, relations, number theory, and induction.
- A smart search bar that recognizes alternative names for topics in discrete math and efficiently redirects readers to the correct entry.
- Excellent internal linking, making it easy to jump from entry to entry.
- A beautiful design, which has a profound effect on learning.
- Built to be as accessible and approachable as possible.
