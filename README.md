## About the project

Discretopia (https://discretopia.com) is an educational website that acts as a unified, organized, and friendly guide to
the essential topics covered in a college-level discrete mathematics course.

With a highly-linked structure inspired by Wikipedia, related concepts are no more than a few clicks away. This level of
interconnectedness provides readers the opportunity to go down a discrete math rabbit hole and satisfy their curiosity.

## Key features

- Well-written, thoughtful entries on 130+ discrete math topics, including: logic, proofs, set theory, functions,
  algorithms, relations, number theory, induction, combinatorics, graph theory, and recursion.
- A smart search bar that recognizes alternative names for topics in discrete math and efficiently redirects readers to
  the correct entry.
- Excellent internal linking, making it easy to jump from entry to entry.
- A beautiful design, which has a profound effect on learning.
- Built to be as accessible and approachable as possible.
